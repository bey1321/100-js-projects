            <p class="quotes">"I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. 
                I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I've been trusted 
                to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and 
                over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."</p>

            <p class="quotes">"I am convinced that about half of what separates 
                successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure 
                perseverance. It's not the prettiest or the most glamorous, but 
                it's what makes the difference between those who reach their goals 
                and those who don't."</p>

            <p class="quotes">"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed 
                by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So 
                throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor, catch the 
                trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."</p>

            <p class="quotes">"True leadership lies in guiding others to success—in 
                ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work 
                they are pledged to do, and doing it well. A leader is someone who 
                takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, 
                and who dares to develop that potential."</p>

            <p class="quotes">"The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into 
                it, move with it, and join the dance. Life is not a problem to be solved 
                but a reality to be experienced. Don't think about what might go wrong; 
                think about what could go right. And as you embark on this journey, embrace 
                each moment, for each one is unique, never to be repeated."</p>

            <p class="quotes">"Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct 
                them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover 
                with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each."</p>
