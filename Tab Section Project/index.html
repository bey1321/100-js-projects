                <h3>Step 1: Prepare and Mix the Batter Carefully</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure your butter, eggs, and milk are at room temperature for a 
                        smooth consistency.</li>
                    <li>Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture becomes light 
                        and fluffy. Gradually add eggs one by one, ensuring each is well 
                        incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt, then alternate adding the 
                        dry mixture and milk to the batter. Stir gently to avoid overmixing, 
                        as this will help keep the cake soft.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-container inactive step-2">
                <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cake Properly</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) and prepare your pan by greasing it 
                        and lining it with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan and lightly tap it to release 
                        any trapped air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Place the pan in the oven and bake for the recommended time or until a 
                        toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Be careful not to 
                        overbake, as this can dry out the cake.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="text-container inactive step-3">
                <h3>Step 3: Cool, Decorate, and Serve</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the cake is baked, let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before 
                        carefully transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                    <li>After the cake has fully cooled, you can decorate it with your choice 
                        of frosting, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Slice and 
                        serve your deliciously soft cake to enjoy!</li>
